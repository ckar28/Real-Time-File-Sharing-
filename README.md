# Real-Time File Sharing Web Application

## Overview

This web application allows users to securely share files in real-time. It is designed for both senders and receivers to easily exchange files with low latency and instant updates. The project leverages Node.js, Express, and Socket.io to enable real-time communication and collaboration.

## Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: The application uses Socket.io to facilitate real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server. This enables instant updates and notifications for both senders and receivers.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Senders can create share rooms, while receivers can easily connect to specific rooms using room IDs.

- **Efficient File Sharing**: Files are shared efficiently with features like file chunking and progress tracking. Files can be sent in chunks, and progress is displayed to users.

- **Client-Side Download**: Receivers can download files directly from the client-side, enhancing the user experience and making it convenient to access shared files.

## Architecture

The project adopts a hybrid architecture that combines elements of both client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication. It uses Node.js and Express to serve web content and Socket.io for real-time communication. This architecture provides scalability, centralized control, and low-latency updates.
